# Code 
These are the two Java EE projects used in the demo during the Lunch&Learn presentation.

* *payarademo:* is a Java EE project with a rest-api and a websocket endpoint. The application allows you to check how different JSR are provided by this application server.
* *democluster:* is another Java EE project that shows the session id. The idea is to run 2 or more instances of this webapplication to check how the clustering feature works.
